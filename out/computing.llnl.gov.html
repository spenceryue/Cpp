This is the first tutorial in the "Livermore Computing Getting Started" workshop. It is intended to provide only a very quick overview of the extensive and broad topic of Parallel Computing, as a lead-in for the tutorials that follow it.  As such, it covers just the very basics of parallel computing, and is intended for someone who is just becoming acquainted with the subject and who is planning to attend one or more of the other tutorials in this workshop. It is not intended to cover Parallel Programming in depth, as this would require significantly more time. The tutorial begins with a discussion on parallel computing - what it is and how it's used, followed by a discussion on concepts and terminology associated with parallel computing. The topics of parallel memory architectures and programming models are then explored. These topics are followed by a series of practical discussions on a number of the complex issues related to designing and running parallel programs. The tutorial concludes with several examples of how to parallelize simple serial programs.

<LI><B>SAVE TIME AND/OR MONEY:</B> 
    <UL>
    <LI>In theory, throwing more resources at a task will shorten its time to 
        completion, with potential cost savings. 
    <LI>Parallel computers can be built from cheap, commodity components.

<H2>Some General Parallel Terminology</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Like everything else, parallel computing has its own "jargon".  Some of the 
    more commonly used terms associated with parallel computing are listed below.
<P>
<LI>Most of these will be discussed in more detail later.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Supercomputing / High Performance Computing (HPC)</B>
<DD>Using the world's fastest and largest computers to solve large problems. 
<P>
<DT><B>Node </B>
<DD>A standalone "computer in a box". Usually comprised of multiple CPUs/processors/cores, memory, network interfaces, etc. Nodes are networked 
together to comprise a supercomputer.
<P>
<DT><B>CPU / Socket / Processor / Core </B>
<DD>This varies, depending upon who you talk to. In the past, a CPU (Central Processing Unit) was a singular execution component for a computer. Then, multiple CPUs were incorporated into a node. Then, individual CPUs were subdivided into multiple "cores", each being a unique execution unit. CPUs with multiple cores are sometimes called "sockets" - vendor dependent. The result is a node with multiple CPUs, each containing multiple cores. The nomenclature is confused at times. Wonder why?
<P>
<IMG SRC=images/nodeSocketCores.jpg WIDTH=800 HEIGTH=375>
<P>
<DT><B>Task </B>
<DD>A logically discrete section of computational work.  A task is typically a 
    program or program-like set of instructions that is executed by a processor.
    A parallel program consists of multiple tasks running on multiple processors.
<P>
<DT><B>Pipelining</B>
<DD>Breaking a task into steps performed by different processor units, with inputs streaming through, much like an assembly line; a type of parallel computing.
<P>
<DT><B>Shared Memory </B>
<DD>From a strictly hardware point of view, describes a computer architecture
    where all processors have direct (usually bus based) access to common 
    physical memory.  In a programming sense, it describes a model where
    parallel tasks all have the same "picture" of memory and can directly
    address and access the same logical memory locations regardless 
    of where the physical memory actually exists.
<P>
<DT><B>Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP)</B>
<DD>Shared memory hardware architecture where multiple processors share a single address space and have equal access to all resources.
<P>
<DT><B>Distributed Memory </B>
<DD>In hardware, refers to network based memory access for physical memory that 
    is not common. As a programming model, tasks can only logically "see" 
    local machine memory and must use communications to access memory on other
    machines where other tasks are executing.
<P>
<DT><B>Communications </B>
<DD>Parallel tasks typically need to exchange data.  There are several ways this can be accomplished, such as through a shared memory bus or over a network, however the actual event of data exchange is commonly referred to as communications regardless of the method employed.
<P>
<DT><B>Synchronization </B>
<DD>The coordination of parallel tasks in real time, very often associated with
communications. Often implemented by establishing a synchronization point within an application where a task may not proceed further until another task(s) reaches the same or logically equivalent point.
<P>
Synchronization usually involves waiting by at least one task, and can therefore cause a parallel application's wall clock execution time to increase.
<P>
<DT><B>Granularity </B>
<DD> In parallel computing, granularity is a qualitative measure of the ratio
    of computation to communication. 
    <UL>
    <LI><B><I>Coarse: </I></B> relatively large amounts of computational work  
        are done between communication events
    <LI><B><I>Fine:</I></B> relatively small amounts of computational work are 
        done between communication events
    </UL>
<P><DT><B>Observed Speedup </B>
<DD>Observed speedup of a code which has been parallelized, defined as:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center>
<PRE>wall-clock time of serial execution
-----------------------------------
 wall-clock time of parallel execution</PRE></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>
One of the simplest and most widely used indicators for a parallel program's performance.
<P>
<DT><B>Parallel Overhead </B>
<DD>The amount of time required to coordinate parallel tasks, as opposed to     
    doing useful work. Parallel overhead can include factors such as:
    <UL>
    <LI>Task start-up time
    <LI>Synchronizations
    <LI>Data communications
    <LI>Software overhead imposed by parallel languages, libraries, 
        operating system, etc.
    <LI>Task termination time
    </UL>
<P>
<DT><B>Massively Parallel </B>
<DD>Refers to the hardware that comprises a given parallel system - having many processing elements. The meaning of "many" keeps increasing, but currently, the largest parallel computers are comprised of processing elements numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions.
<P>
<DT><B>Embarrassingly Parallel</B> 
<DD>Solving many similar, but independent tasks
simultaneously; little to no need for coordination between the tasks.
<P>
<DT><B>Scalability</B>
<DD>Refers to a parallel system's (hardware and/or software) ability to demonstrate a proportionate increase in parallel speedup with the addition of more resources. Factors that contribute to scalability include:
    <UL>
    <LI>Hardware - particularly memory-cpu bandwidths and network communication

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Portability:</SPAN>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Thanks to standardization in several APIs, such as MPI, POSIX threads,
    and OpenMP, portability issues with parallel programs are not as
    serious as in years past.  However...
<P>
<LI>All of the usual portability issues associated with serial programs

<P>
<LI>Even though standards exist for several APIs, implementations will differ
    in a number of details, sometimes to the point of requiring code 
    modifications in order to effect portability.

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Resource Requirements:</SPAN>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>The primary intent of parallel programming is to decrease execution
    wall clock time, however in order to accomplish this, more CPU time
    is required.  For example, a parallel code that runs in 1 hour on 8
    processors actually uses 8 hours of CPU time.
<P>
<LI>The amount of memory required can be greater for parallel codes than
    serial codes, due to the need to replicate data and for overheads
    associated with parallel support libraries and subsystems.
<P>
<LI>For short running parallel programs, there can actually be a decrease
    in performance compared to a similar serial implementation.  The overhead 
    costs associated with setting up the parallel environment, task creation,
    communications and task termination can comprise a significant portion of
    the total execution time for short runs.

    scaling.
<P>

<IMG SRC=images/strongWeakScaling.gif ALIGN=right HSPACE=20 WIDTH=300>
<LI><B>Strong scaling:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>The total problem size stays fixed as more processors are added.
<LI>Goal is to run the same problem size faster
<LI>Perfect scaling means problem is solved in 1/P time (compared to serial)
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Weak scaling:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>The problem size <I>per processor</I> stays fixed as more processors are added.
<LI>Goal is to run larger problem in same amount of time
<LI>Perfect scaling means problem Px runs in same time as single processor run
</UL>
<P>
<LI>The ability of a parallel program's performance to scale is a result
    of a number of interrelated factors.  Simply adding more processors
    is rarely the answer.
<P>
<LI>The algorithm may have inherent limits to scalability.  At some point,
    adding more resources causes performance to decrease.  This is a common
    situation with many parallel applications.
<P>
<LI>Hardware factors play a significant role in scalability.  Examples:
    <UL>
    <LI>Memory-cpu bus bandwidth on an SMP machine
    <LI>Communications network bandwidth
    <LI>Amount of memory available on any given machine or set of machines
    <LI>Processor clock speed

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>General Characteristics:</SPAN>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Like shared memory systems, distributed memory systems vary widely but 
    share a common characteristic. Distributed memory systems require a 
    communication network to connect inter-processor memory.
<P>
<IMG SRC=images/distributed_mem.gif WIDTH=484 HEIGHT=196 HSPACE=10>
<P>
<LI>Processors have their own local memory.  Memory addresses in one 
    processor do not map to another processor, so there is no concept of
    global address space across all processors.
<P>
<LI>Because each processor has its own local memory, it operates 
    independently. Changes it makes to its local memory have no effect
    on the memory of other processors.  Hence, the concept of cache
    coherency does not apply.
<P>
<LI>When a processor needs access to data in another processor, it is 
    usually the task of the programmer to explicitly define how and when
    data is communicated.  Synchronization between tasks is likewise the
    programmer's responsibility.
<P>
<LI>The network "fabric" used for data transfer varies widely, though it can
    be as simple as Ethernet.
</UL>
<P>

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Advantages:</SPAN>
    <UL>
    <LI>Memory is scalable with the number of processors. Increase the number of    
        processors and the size of memory increases proportionately. 
    <LI>Each processor can rapidly access its own memory without interference
        and without the overhead incurred with trying to maintain global cache
        coherency.
    <LI>Cost effectiveness: can use commodity, off-the-shelf processors and
        networking.
    </UL>
<P>

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Disadvantages:</SPAN>
    <UL>
    <LI>The programmer is responsible for many of the details associated with
        data communication between processors. 
    <LI>It may be difficult to map existing data structures, based on global
        memory, to this memory organization. 
    <LI>Non-uniform memory access times - data residing on a remote node
        takes longer to access than node local data.

<H2>Shared Memory Model (without threads)</H2>

<UL>
<IMG SRC=images/sharedMemoryModel.gif WIDTH=350 HSPACE=20 ALIGN=right>
<LI>In this programming model, processes/tasks share a common address space,  
    which they read and write to asynchronously. 
<P>
<LI>Various mechanisms such as locks / semaphores are used to control
    access to the shared memory, resolve contentions and to prevent race 
    conditions and deadlocks. 
<P>
<LI>This is perhaps the simplest parallel programming model.
<P>
<LI>An advantage of this model from the programmer's point of view is that the
    notion of data "ownership" is lacking, so there is no need to specify 
    explicitly the communication of data between tasks. All processes see and
    have equal access to shared memory. Program development can often be 
    simplified.
<P>
<LI>An important disadvantage in terms of performance is that it becomes
    more difficult to understand and manage <B><I>data locality</I></B>:
    <UL>
    <LI>Keeping data local to the process that works on it conserves memory
        accesses, cache refreshes and bus traffic that occurs when multiple
        processes use the same data.
    <LI>Unfortunately, controlling data locality is hard to understand and 
        may be beyond the control of the average user.

<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Implementations:</SPAN>
<UL>
    <P>

        For example, the POSIX standard provides an API for using shared memory,
        and UNIX provides shared memory segments (shmget, shmat, shmctl, etc).
    <P>
    <LI>On distributed memory machines, memory is physically distributed 
        across a network of machines, but made global through specialized hardware 
        and software. A variety of SHMEM implementations are available:

<H2>Threads Model</H2>

<UL>
<P>
<LI>This programming model is a type of shared memory programming.
<P>
<LI>In the threads model of parallel programming, a single "heavy weight" 
    process can have multiple "light weight", concurrent execution paths.
<P>
<LI>For example:

    <UL>
    <P>
    <LI>The main program <B>a.out</B> is scheduled to run by the
        native operating system. <B>a.out</B> loads and acquires all of the
        necessary system and user resources to run. This is the "heavy weight"
        process.
    <P>
    <LI><B>a.out</B> performs some serial work, and then creates
        a number of tasks (threads) that can be scheduled and run by the
        operating system concurrently.  
    <P>
    <LI>Each thread has local data, but also, shares the entire resources of 
        <B>a.out</B>.  This saves the overhead associated with
        replicating a program's resources for each thread ("light weight").  
        Each thread also benefits from a global memory view because it shares the
        memory space of <B>a.out</B>.      
    <P>
    <LI>A thread's work may best be described as a subroutine within
        the main program.  Any thread can execute any subroutine at the
        same time as other threads.
    <P>
    <LI>Threads communicate with each other through global memory (updating
        address locations).  This requires synchronization constructs to ensure
        that more than one thread is not updating the same global address at
        any time.
    <P>
    <LI>Threads can come and go, but <B>a.out</B> remains present 
        to provide the necessary shared resources until the
        application has completed.

<H2>Automatic vs. Manual Parallelization</H2>

<UL>
<P>
<LI>Designing and developing parallel programs has characteristically been a
    very manual process.  The programmer is typically responsible for 
    both identifying and actually implementing parallelism. 
<P>
<LI>Very often, manually developing parallel codes is a time consuming,
    complex, error-prone and <I><B>iterative</B></I> process.
<P>
<LI>For a number of years now, various tools have been available to assist
    the programmer with converting serial programs into parallel programs.
    The most common type of tool used to automatically parallelize a serial
    program is a parallelizing compiler or pre-processor.
<P>
<LI>A parallelizing compiler generally works in two different ways:
<P>
<B>Fully Automatic</B>
<UL>
<LI>The compiler analyzes the source code and identifies opportunities for 
    parallelism.  
<LI>The analysis includes identifying inhibitors to parallelism and possibly a cost 
    weighting on whether or not the parallelism would actually
    improve performance.
<LI>Loops (do, for) are the most frequent target for
    automatic parallelization.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Programmer Directed</B>
<UL>
<LI>Using "compiler directives" or possibly compiler flags,
    the programmer explicitly tells the compiler how to
    parallelize the code.
<LI>May be able to be used in conjunction with some degree of 
    automatic parallelization also.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>The most common compiler generated parallelization is done using
    on-node shared memory and threads (such as OpenMP).
<P>
<LI>If you are beginning with an existing serial code and have time
    or budget constraints, then automatic parallelization may be 
    the answer.  However, there are several important caveats that
    apply to automatic parallelization:
    <UL>
    <LI>Wrong results may be produced
    <LI>Performance may actually degrade
    <LI>Much less flexible than manual parallelization
    <LI>Limited to a subset (mostly loops) of code
    <LI>May actually not parallelize code if the compiler analysis suggests there
        are inhibitors or the code is too complex
    </UL><P>
<LI>The remainder of this section applies to the manual method of 
    developing parallel codes.

<H2>Partitioning</H2>

<UL>
<P>
<LI>One of the first steps in designing a parallel program is to break the
    problem into discrete "chunks" of work that can be distributed to
    multiple tasks.  This is known as decomposition or partitioning.
<P>
<LI>There are two basic ways to partition computational work among parallel 
    tasks: <B><I>domain decomposition</I></B> and 
    <B><I>functional decomposition</I></B>. 
</UL>
<P>

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Domain Decomposition:</SPAN>
    <UL>
    <P>
    <LI>In this type of partitioning, the data associated with a problem
        is decomposed.  Each parallel task then works on a portion of
        the data.
    <P><IMG SRC=images/domain_decomp.gif WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=216>

    </UL>
<P>

<IMG SRC=../images/arrowBullet.gif ALIGN=top HSPACE=3>
<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Functional Decomposition:</SPAN>
    <UL>
    <P>
    <LI>In this approach, the focus is on the computation that is to be      
        performed rather than on the data manipulated by the computation.
        The problem is decomposed according to the work that must be done.
        Each task then performs a portion of the overall work.
    <P><IMG SRC=images/functional_decomp.gif WIDTH=587 HEIGHT=353>
    <P>
    <LI>Functional decomposition lends itself well to problems that can be

        <P>
        <DT><B>Ecosystem Modeling</B>
        <BR>Each program calculates the population
            of a given group, where each group's growth depends on that of its
            neighbors. As time progresses, each process calculates
            its current state, then exchanges information with the neighbor  
            populations. All tasks then progress to calculate the state at the
            next time step.

        <IMG SRC=images/functional_ex1.gif WIDTH=567 HEIGHT=221>
        <P>
        <DT><B>Signal Processing</B>
        <BR>An audio signal data set is passed
            through four distinct computational filters. Each filter is a 
            separate process. The first segment of data must pass through the
            first filter before progressing to the second. When it does, the
            second segment of data passes through the first filter. By the time
            the fourth segment of data is in the first filter, all four
            tasks are busy.

        <P>
        <DT><B>Climate Modeling</B>
        <BR>Each model component can be thought of as a separate task.
            Arrows represent exchanges of data between components during
            computation: the atmosphere model generates wind velocity data

            and so on.

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=90%>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD><B>You DON'T need communications:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Some types of problems can be decomposed and executed in parallel
    with virtually no need for tasks to share data. These types of problems are 
    often called <B><I>embarrassingly parallel</I></B> - little or no communications
    are required. 
<LI>For example, imagine an
    image processing operation where every pixel in a black and white image

<SPAN CLASS=heading3>Factors to Consider:</SPAN>
<UL>
<P>
There are a number of important factors to consider when designing your
program's inter-task communications:
<P>
<IMG SRC=images/commOverhead.jpg ALIGN=right HSPACE=20 WIDTH=250>
<LI><B>Communication overhead</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>Inter-task communication virtually always implies overhead.
    <LI>Machine cycles and resources that could be used for computation
        are instead used to package and transmit data.
    <LI>Communications frequently require some type of synchronization
        between tasks, which can result in tasks spending time "waiting"
        instead of doing work.
    <LI>Competing communication traffic can saturate the available network
        bandwidth, further aggravating performance problems.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Latency vs. Bandwidth</B>
    <UL>
    <LI><B><I>latency</I></B> is the time it takes to send a minimal (0 byte)
        message from point A to point B.  Commonly expressed as microseconds.
    <LI><B><I>bandwidth</I></B> is the amount of data that can be communicated
        per unit of time.  Commonly expressed as megabytes/sec or gigabytes/sec.
    <LI>Sending many small messages can cause latency to dominate communication
        overheads.  Often it is more efficient to package small messages into a
        larger message, thus increasing the effective communications bandwidth.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Visibility of communications</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>With the Message Passing Model, communications are explicit and
        generally quite visible and under the control of the programmer.  
    <LI>With the Data Parallel Model, communications often occur
        transparently to the programmer, particularly on distributed 
        memory architectures.  The programmer may not even be able to
        know exactly how inter-task communications are being accomplished.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Synchronous vs. asynchronous communications</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>Synchronous communications require some type of "handshaking"
        between tasks that are sharing data.  This can be explicitly
        structured in code by the programmer, or it may happen at a
        lower level unknown to the programmer.
    <LI>Synchronous communications are often referred to as
        <B><I>blocking</I></B> communications since other work must
        wait until the communications have completed.
    <LI>Asynchronous communications allow tasks to transfer data independently
        from one another. For example, task 1 can prepare and send a
        message to task 2, and then immediately begin doing other work.
        When task 2 actually receives the data doesn't matter. 
    <LI>Asynchronous communications are often referred to as
        <B><I>non-blocking</I></B> communications since other work can
        be done while the communications are taking place.
    <LI>Interleaving computation with communication is the single greatest
        benefit for using asynchronous communications.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Scope of communications</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>Knowing which tasks must communicate with each other is critical during
        the design stage of a parallel code. Both of the two scopings 
        described below can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously.
    <LI><B><I>Point-to-point</I></B> - involves two tasks with one task
        acting as the sender/producer of data, and the other acting as 
        the receiver/consumer.
    <LI><B><I>Collective</I></B> - involves data sharing between more than
        two tasks, which are often specified as being members in a common 
        group, or collective. Some common variations (there are more):
    <P>
    <IMG SRC=images/collective_comm.gif> 
    </UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Efficiency of communications</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>Oftentimes, the programmer has choices that can affect communications
        performance.  Only a few are mentioned here.        
    <LI>Which implementation for a given model should be used?  Using
        the Message Passing Model as an
        example, one MPI implementation may be faster on a given
        hardware platform than another.
    <LI>What type of communication operations should be used?  As
        mentioned previously, asynchronous communication operations
        can improve overall program performance.
    <LI>Network fabric - some platforms may offer more than one network
        for communications.  Which one is best?

    <P>
    <LI>Rule #1: Reduce overall I/O as much as possible
    <P>
    <LI>If you have access to a parallel file system, use it.
    <P>
    <LI>Writing large chunks of data rather than small chunks is usually
        significantly more efficient.
    <P>
    <LI>Fewer, larger files performs better than many small files.
    <P>
    <LI>Confine I/O to specific serial portions of the job, and then use
        parallel communications to distribute data to parallel tasks.
        For example, Task 1 could read an input file and then communicate
        required data to other tasks.  Likewise, Task 1 could perform
        write operation after receiving required data from all other tasks.
